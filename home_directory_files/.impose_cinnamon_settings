To backup:

From a terminal, run:

dconf dump /org/cinnamon/ > backup_of_my_cinnamon_settings

save the backup_of_my_cinnamon_settings file somewhere for later

To reset to defaults:

dconf reset -f /org/cinnamon/

Note, cinnamon may freeze or crash doing this

To restore all your settings:

dconf load /org/cinnamon/ < backup_of_my_cinnamon_settings

Again, cinnamon may freeze crash after this (recommend at least logging out/back in)
